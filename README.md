As a space nerd, I often find myself in a pickle trying to find certain interesting astronomical events. Search engines take too long and are often inaccurate for more complex information. So I decided to tackle this issue! This would be useful for anyone who needs information about space events. It uses Wolfram to compute different astronomical events based on user input. For example, if a user wanted to know when the next solar eclipse was after March 31, 2027, the program can tell them. The program can do other computations and plots as well!
